# Intro
## What is grammar inference?
## How can it be used?
# Methods
## Algorithms
### L*
### Observation Pack
### TTT
## Teacher
- MAT from Anguilin
- Perfect Teacher
    - Regex to DFA conversion
    - DFA equivalence
## Other Utilities
- Regex enumerator (CFG based)
# Comparisons
- Compare number of membership and equivalence queries by adding a counter to the MAT class
- Compare running times for very large regex
# Results
- Compare average membership / equivalence query counter
- Choose regex of interest and compare for these - maybe even include run times
- Give examples of dtree and hypothesis returned
# Conclusions
- Compare performance
    - Discrimination tree algorithms have more membership queries but less equivalence queries
- TTT is significantly more complicated to implement than other algorithms but uses less equivalence queries
