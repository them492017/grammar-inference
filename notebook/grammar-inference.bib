	title = {An {Abstract} {Framework} for {Counterexample} {Analysis} in {Active} {Automata} {Learning}},
	abstract = {Counterexample analysis has emerged as one of the key challenges in Angluin-style active automata learning. Rivest and Schapire showed for the L * algorithm that a single suffix of the counterexample was sufficient to ensure progress. This suffix can be obtained in a binary search fashion, requiring Θ(log m) membership queries for a counterexample of length m. Correctly implementing this algorithm can be quite tricky, and its correctness sometimes even has been disputed. In this paper, we establish an abstract framework for counterexample analysis, which basically reduces the problem of finding a suffix to finding distinct neighboring elements in a 0/1 sequence, where the first element is 0 and the last element is 1. We demonstrate the conciseness and simplicity of our framework by using it to present new counterexample analysis algorithms, which, while maintaining the worst-case complexity of O(log m), perform significantly better in practice. Furthermore, we contribute—in a second instantiation of our framework, highlighting its generality—the first sublinear counterexample analysis procedures for the algorithm due to Kearns and Vazirani.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present TTT, a novel active automata learning algorithm formulated in the Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) framework. The distinguishing characteristic of TTT is its redundancyfree organization of observations, which can be exploited to achieve optimal (linear) space complexity. This is thanks to a thorough analysis of counterexamples, extracting and storing only the essential reﬁning information. TTT is therefore particularly well-suited for application in a runtime veriﬁcation context, where counterexamples (obtained, e.g., via monitoring) may be excessively long: as the execution time of a test sequence typically grows with its length, this would otherwise cause severe performance degradation. We illustrate the impact of TTT’s consequent redundancy-free approach along a number of examples.},

	abstract = {Accurate description of program inputs remains a critical challenge in the field of programming languages. Active learning, as a well-established field, achieves exact learning for regular languages. We offer an innovative grammar inference tool, V-Star, based on the active learning of visibly pushdown automata. V-Star deduces nesting structures of program input languages from sample inputs, employing a novel inference mechanism based on nested patterns. This mechanism identifies token boundaries and converts languages such as XML documents into VPLs. We then adapted Angluin's L-Star, an exact learning algorithm, for VPA learning, which improves the precision of our tool. Our evaluation demonstrates that V-Star effectively and efficiently learns a variety of practical grammars, including S-Expressions, JSON, and XML, and outperforms other state-of-the-art tools.},

	abstract = {The problem of identifying an unknown regular set from examples of its members and nonmembers is addressed. It is assumed that the regular set is presented by a minimally adequate Teacher, which can answer membership queries about the set and can also test a conjecture and indicate whether it is equal to the unknown set and provide a counterexample if not. (A counterexample is a string in the symmetric difference of the correct set and the conjectured set.) A learning algorithm L∗ is described that correctly learns any regular set from any minimally adequate Teacher in time polynomial in the number of states of the minimum dfa for the set and the maximum length of any counterexample provided by the Teacher. It is shown that in a stochastic setting the ability of the Teacher to test conjectures may be replaced by a random sampling oracle, EX( ). A polynomial-time learning algorithm is shown for a particular problem of context-free language identification.},
